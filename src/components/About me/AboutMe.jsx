              Hi! I'm a <span>software developer</span> with a passion for
              crafting engaging, functional, and visually appealing{" "}
              <span>web</span> and <span>mobile applications</span>. What
              excites me most about this field is the perfect blend of{" "}
              <span>creativity</span> and <span>logical problem-solving</span>
              â€”every project is a new challenge to bring ideas to life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently, I work at <span>Enhancers</span>, where I develop
              applications using <span>React Native</span>, continuously
              refining my skills in both <span>front-end</span> and{" "}
              <span>mobile development</span>. Through my past experiences, I've
              honed my ability to <span>collaborate effectively in teams</span>{" "}
              and maintain a <span>patient, solution-oriented mindset</span>{" "}
              even under pressure.
            </p>
            <p>
              In May 2021, I joined <span>Strive School</span>, a transformative
              experience that allowed me to develop numerous{" "}
              <span>team-based</span> and <span>individual projects</span> in a
              fully <span>remote, international environment</span>. This journey
              not only strengthened my technical skills but also refined my
              ability to adapt and excel in dynamic, fast-paced settings.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here are a few of the technologies I've been working with
              recently:
